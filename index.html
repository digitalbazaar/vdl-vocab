      <h3>Alternative Data Model Expression</h3>

      <p>
The ISO 18013 Mobile Driver's License data model and W3C Verifiable Credentials data model during design had different requirements, meaning the
optimal way to model a drivers license within each standard is different. The above model is aimed to preserve the ISO 18013 Mobile Driver's License data model
when expressed as a W3C Verifiable Credential, whereas the below expresses the same information conveyed in a ISO 18013 Mobile Driver's License, however
modelled in a way that is in keeping with the W3C Verifiable Credentials standard.
